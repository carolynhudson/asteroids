This is based on the Boot.dev course of the same name.  I didn't like the look and feel of the finished project so I brought it closer to what I remembered the coin-op asteroids game to be like. I don't have the flying saucers in yet and have not implimented a game over screen or high score memory.  I had wanted to add sounds but I have the project in WSL right now so no sound for now until I put in the work to test how hard it is to get puleaudio working in WSL.
